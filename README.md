#####Problem:
Analyse NYC MTA traffic flows to efficiently allocate the street workforce to capture as many emails as possible

#####Approach:
Given that that we do not have enough information to incorporate conversion rates, we have focused our solution on the following:       

- Maximising exposure to traffic given limited street workforce resources

- Focused on the main sources of variation in traffic volumes (day of the week, time of day)

- Used data from May 2016 to anticipate street team deployment in May 2017

#####Findings:
Based on our analyses of the MTA turnstile data from May 2016, we conclude that volume of foot traffic at subway stations are:

- Highly concentrated in a handful of stations

- Consistently high for weekdays but lower on the weekend

- Highly variable by time of day. Weekday traffic is mainly driven by rush-hour commuters.

#####Recommendations:
By deploying street resources in the right stations at the right times, you will be able to maximise exposure to foot traffic.
